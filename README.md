# Fishing-Thing
This is where I am gonna be holding the code for my small personal project. I figured this is a way to come up with something interesting as well as be able to show understanding of general concepts in Python.

Recently I have been getting into fishing and would like to make a program to help me predict good fishing days and other useful info. My goal is to build this in an iterative way by coding a basic bones program and add features that help me learn or experiment with new concepts.

Examples of layout. (I will try my best to keep this current. The plan is to update these every so often when significant changes happen.)
