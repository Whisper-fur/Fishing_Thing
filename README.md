# Fishing-Thing
This is where I am gonna be holding the code for my small personal project. I figured this is a way to come up with somehting interesting as well as be able to show understanding of general concepts in Python.

recently I have been getting into fishing and would like to make a program to help me predict good fishing days and other useful info. My goal is to build this in an iterative way by coding a basic bones program and add features that help me learn or experiment with new concepts.
